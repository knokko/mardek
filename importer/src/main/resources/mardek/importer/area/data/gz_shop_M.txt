People and spells are all monoelemental, and their Element determines their power, potential, and, in the case of people, their personalities."],["","There are seven known elements, divided into three distinct groups. There are the Natural Elements, which Nature is composed largely of; there are the Moral Elements, which are born from the essence of free will and the spirit of life and choice; there is also the odd Spiritual element group, which eludes many thaumatologists to this day."],["","There are four Natural elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - two Moral elements - Dark and Light - and only one known Spiritual element - Ether - though Ether\'s existence is largely considered mythical."],["","FIRE is the element of energy and devotion, of passion and strength. Fire people are strong-willed, opinionative, confident and powerful. They\'re driven, and strive to achieve goals. They can be stubborn."],["","WATER is the element of intellect, of calmness, of beauty. Water people are often laid-back, and \'go with the flow\'. They\'re often good-looking, intelligent, and perceptive. Many have strong magical power, making ideal Mages or Wizards."],["","AIR is the element of adventure, of wandering, of drifting, of dreaming. Air people are dreamers, but they\'re floaty and rarely focused on one thing for long. Many travellers and wanderers and Adventurers are of the Air element, \'living on the edge of the wind\'."],["","EARTH is the element of wisdom, common sense and hardiness. Earth people are usually tough and practical, and most certainly \'down to Earth\'. They are wise and understanding, trustworthy, honest and reliable. They can be extremely devoted to a cause or way of life, and are also good at solving puzzles."],["","LIGHT is the elemental epitome of goodness and justice. People with this element will live to Do Good, helping people whenever they can. They live for others moreso than for themselves. They are the most helpful, kind and caring of elements, and often become Heroes."],["","DARK is the elemental epitome of evil. Dark people are inherently self-centred and manipulative, often violent. They only do things to benefit themselves, and care little for other people. They are the polar opposites of Light people."],["","ETHER is still a mystery, as it occurs so rarely as to be considered almost mythical. Not much is written about it, and what is written is not highly reliable."],["","There are rumours of an eighth element, but that is all they are; rumours. Myths. There\'s no known evidence to support such claims."],["","The personality traits mentioned for each element in this book are the most common for those elements, but are by no means the only personalities such people can have.

Thus is the cycle of the Natural elements."],["","The Moral elements, being antipodes of one another, polar opposites, oppose each other in a unique way. Light floods, consumes and thus eradicates the Darkness, but in turn Darkness puts out the light. These two elements are both strong and weak against each other simultaneously."],["","Not much is known about the other elements\' traits, if indeed they exist at all. Is Ether strong or weak against anything? We do not know."],["","Though these elemental traits are most often exploited on the battlefield, they can cause influence in day-to-day life too. A fire-elemental person will inherently (though unwillingly) be more submissive to a water-elemental person, and that water person will be more bossy and demanding around fire people, exuding an unwilling and unconscious dominance.

Females, secretly lusting being dominated and ravished, are attracted to men of the element superior to themselves. So such matches work rather well."],["","People of the same element can also work excellently together; similarity at the most fundamental levels has many times been the cause for a great love blossoming and flourishing."],["","Such things as have been mentioned apply only to people with Natural elements; for people with a Moral element, different rules apply. Naturally, they are attracted to people of the same element as themselves, but also to any and all of the Natural elements. Because of this, Morally-elemental people have more choice when it comes to finding a partner that\'s right for them."],["","A relationship between the two Moral elements - that is, a Light and Dark couple - CANNOT work, both emotionally and physically. The two people will never get along or fall in love, and even if they did, a child could never physically be conceived in such a relationship."],["","When a child is born to other couples, however, its element is inherited from its parents. In a dominant-element relationship, the child is of the dominant element. In same-element relationships, the child is of the element both parents share.
